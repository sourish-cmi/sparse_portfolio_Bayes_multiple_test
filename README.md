### Hierarchical Bayes with Horse Shoe Prior model for Portfolio Selection and Back testing 
1) <b>Factor_Model_HB_selection.R</b> file contain a function named '<i>Factor_Model_HB_selection</i>'. It implement the Gibbs sampling for &beta; and Metropolis update for scale parameters &sigma; and &Sigma; with Horse Shoe prior on shrinkage parameter.
2) <b>Factor_Model_HB_Back_testing.R</b> file contain a function named '<i>Factor_Model_HB_Back_testing</i>'.
